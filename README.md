# Visual Monte Carlo Localization

Monte Carlo Localization implemented in Python and OpenCV. Utilizes fully wireless robotics platform with a Raspberry Pi and Create iRobot. 

Instructions for setup can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/zhangxingshuo/py-robot).

A Monte Carlo Localization algorithm with motion blur correction was developed and released in [this repository](https://github.com/zhangxingshuo/py-mcl).

Finally, a fully autonomous navigation script was piloted and tested in [this repository](https://github.com/zhangxingshuo/py-nav).
