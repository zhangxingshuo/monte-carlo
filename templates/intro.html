   <h1> Webpage Magic </h1>
   <p>
     Behind every website on the Internet, there is an intricate web of code
     that allows it to run smoothly and efficiently, all while looking pretty!
     Most of these under-the-hood operations go unnoticed and neglected :( and
     thus, are rarely understood by the casual user. However, we in CS 5 are
     not the casual user! We are going to delve into the inner-workings of
     websites using tools already built into your browser! With these tools,
     you&#39;ll be able to do things like change the text, colors, and images on
     any webpage!
   </p>
   <p>
      Every browser comes with a handy tool called the Web Inspector which can
      help you, the developer, get a better grasp of the code behind any
      website. This week, your task is to delve into the web inspector built
      into your browser and change a page! The examples in this lesson are done using
      Google Chrome, but there are similar looking web inspectors in browsers all
      across the board. To follow along, you&#39;ll probably want to know where to find
      Inspect Element, and that is a quick process outlined
      <a href="http://thewc.co.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/inspect-element-open.gif">here</a>.
      Or, you can usually use F12 to access it.
    </p>
    <!-- DO YOU SEE ME? -->
    <p>
      Now, the first thing you will notice when opening web inspector is the
      different portions of the page that light up when you move your mouse
      over the code. This is an extremely handy tool because it shows you what
      part of the web page the code is referring to. Let&#39;s take this
      <a href="http://flask-env.ngqzj2ms3t.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">
        spammy website.
      </a> for example:
     </p>
     <p>
       This is the part we are focusing on. All the contents of the web page
       are housed in this code. As you might be able to infer, the large
       elements of the page are divided up into sections marked by the
       &lt;div&gt; tag. Your intuition might tell you that the best place to
       edit the text on the page is in the class &quot;body&quot; Open up the
       &quot;body&quot; tab and explore all the &quot;&lt;h(number)&gt;
       &lt;/h(number)&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&quot; markers
       (you&#39;ll learn what these markers mean next week). In it,
       you&#39;ll find some text that is also found on the web page itself! A
       simple double click on the text will allow you to change it. The text
       change will then be reflected on the web page in real time!
      </p>
     <h2 id="diffHead"> Can you spot the differences? </h2>
     <div class="diffCont">
         <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='diff1.png')}}" width="49%"/>
         <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='diff2.png')}}" width="49%" />
     </div>
     <!-- This is inline CSS. It modifies a single element -->
     <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Homework</h2>
     <p>
       Go to any website of your choosing (preferably a well-known one, like
       Facebook or Google), open Inspect Element, and play around with it until
       you find a portion of the website that you want to a change. Once you
       have edited the page to your liking (this should be a major change,
       whether it be text, images, or anything else you can find), take a
       screenshot of the original page and the edited version, and submit it
       for extra credit!
